**Please find below the description of the task.**

You should not take more than **3 hours** to familiarize with the code and fulfill the instructions.
When you are done, please get the result to us in one the following ways:

- (preferred) check in the code to your public repository and send us a link to: mareike.teresa.arbesmann@sap.com and team-kiwis@sap.com
- Zip the solution, upload it somewhere and send us the link to the zip (unfortunately sending uz the .zip directly might fail because of security issues).
